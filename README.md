## Environment Setup

1. **Clone and Setup**
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd mercor_task
```

2. **Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Environment Configuration**
```bash
cp environment_template.txt .env
# Edit .env with your API keys:
# - VOYAGE_API_KEY
# - TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY  
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (optional)
# - USER_EMAIL
# - TURBOPUFFER_NAMESPACE
# - MONGO_URL (for validation)
```

## Setup Script (init.py)

The `init.py` script migrates data from MongoDB to Turbopuffer vector database:

```bash
# Run the setup/migration script
python3 init.py migrate

# Optional: Clear existing data first
python3 init.py delete
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `--batch_size`: Number of documents per batch (default: 10000)
- `--threads`: Number of parallel workers (default: 10)

## Retrieval Logic

The main retrieval system (`submission_agent.py`) implements:

### Core Components:
- **Vector Search**: Uses voyage-3 embeddings for semantic similarity
- **BM25 Search**: Keyword-based text matching
- **Soft Filtering**: Preference scoring based on job-specific criteria
- **Hard Filtering**: Must-have requirements filtering
- **Quality Filtering**: AI-powered candidate quality assessment

### Enhanced Features:
- **LinkedIn Validation**: Verifies profile authenticity and completeness
- **MongoDB Cross-Check**: Validates against original data source
- **Experience Analysis**: Smart extraction of years of experience
- **Quality Scoring**: Multi-dimensional candidate assessment

### Usage:
```bash
# Generate final submission with evaluation feedback
python3 submission_agent.py
```

### Key Functions:
- `search_with_criteria()`: Multi-strategy candidate search with quality filtering
- `call_evaluation_endpoint()`: Real-time Mercor evaluation
- `iterative_improvement()`: Score-based optimization with quality thresholds
- `_apply_quality_filtering()`: AI-powered quality assessment and filtering

## Enhanced Validation System

### EnhancedValidationAgent Features:
- **LinkedIn Profile Validation**: Format checking, completeness scoring
- **MongoDB Cross-Validation**: Data integrity and consistency verification  
- **Experience Estimation**: Intelligent parsing of career progression
- **Quality Scoring**: Multi-factor assessment with adaptive thresholds

### Quality Thresholds:
```python
quality_thresholds = {
    'excellent': 0.85,    # High-quality candidates
    'good': 0.70,         # Above-average quality
    'acceptable': 0.55,   # Minimum acceptable quality
    'poor': 0.40          # Below acceptable standards
}
```

### Evaluation Thresholds:
```python
evaluation_thresholds = {
    'target_score': 0.80,         # Target evaluation score
    'minimum_acceptable': 0.60,   # Minimum acceptable score
    'rerun_threshold': 0.50       # Triggers search rerun
}
```

## Evaluation API Integration

The system calls the Mercor evaluation endpoint during processing:

```python
# Example evaluation call with enhanced validation
headers = {"Authorization": "your_email@example.com", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
payload = {"config_path": "tax_lawyer.yml", "object_ids": ["candidate_id_1", ...]}
response = requests.post("https://mercor-dev--search-eng-interview.modal.run/evaluate", 
                        json=payload, headers=headers)
print(f"Overall Score: {response.json()['average_final_score']}")
```

## Approach Summary

### Data Exploration
1. **Schema Analysis**: Analyzed MongoDB structure (193,796 documents)
2. **Field Selection**: Used embedding, rerankSummary, name, email, linkedinId, country
3. **Embedding Strategy**: Leveraged pre-computed voyage-3 embeddings
4. **Quality Assessment**: Added LinkedIn and experience validation

### Indexing Strategy
- **Vector Database**: Turbopuffer for scalable similarity search
- **Schema Design**: Optimized for full-text search on summary field
- **Distance Metric**: Cosine similarity for vector comparisons
- **Enhanced Attributes**: LinkedIn ID and country for validation

### Retrieval Approach
1. **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity (60%) + BM25 (40%) + soft filters (20%)
2. **Domain-Specific Queries**: Tailored search terms per job category
3. **Hard Filtering**: Must-have requirements (JD degree, experience years)
4. **Soft Criteria**: Preference scoring (IRS experience, M&A background, etc.)
5. **Quality Filtering**: AI-powered quality assessment and threshold application

### Validation & Analysis
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Integration with Mercor endpoint during search
- **Iterative Improvement**: Automatic retry with different strategies if scores are low
- **Domain Validation**: Prevents cross-contamination (biology PhDs in math roles)
- **LinkedIn Validation**: Profile authenticity and completeness verification
- **MongoDB Cross-Check**: Data integrity validation against source
- **Performance Metrics**: Track precision, relevance, evaluation scores, and quality

### Key Innovations
1. **Evaluation-Driven Search**: Uses Mercor feedback to improve results in real-time
2. **Multi-Strategy Fallback**: Tries different approaches if initial results are poor
3. **Soft Criteria Matching**: Sophisticated preference scoring beyond basic keyword matching
4. **AI Quality Assessment**: Multi-dimensional candidate quality evaluation
5. **LinkedIn Validation**: Professional profile verification and completeness scoring
6. **MongoDB Cross-Validation**: Real-time data integrity checking

## 🎯 Final Validation System

### Two-Phase Validation Process

**Phase 1: Initial Search & Evaluation**
- Multi-strategy candidate search with quality filtering
- Real-time Mercor evaluation endpoint integration
- Iterative improvement based on evaluation scores

**Phase 2: MongoDB + GPT Final Validation**
- **Complete Data Extraction**: Fetches full candidate profiles from MongoDB source
- **GPT Validation**: Each candidate evaluated by GPT against specific job requirements
- **Iterative Correction**: Unsuitable candidates automatically replaced
- **Loop Until Perfect**: Process continues until both Mercor evaluation and GPT validation pass

### Final Validation Features

#### 🗄️ MongoDB Data Extraction
```python
# Extracts comprehensive candidate data including:
candidate_data = {
    "name", "email", "summary", "linkedin_id", "country",
    "full_profile", "experience", "education", "skills", 
    "position", "company", "location", "industry"
}
```

#### 🤖 GPT Validation Criteria
- **Strict Evaluation Standards**: Only marks candidates as suitable if they genuinely fit
- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**: Experience match, skills match, education match
- **Detailed Reasoning**: Provides specific feedback on why candidates pass/fail
- **Job-Specific Requirements**: Tailored criteria for each of the 10 job categories

#### 🔄 Automatic Correction Loop
```python
# Validation thresholds for candidate acceptance:
if (gpt_validation["is_suitable"] and 
    gpt_validation["overall_score"] >= 0.6 and
    gpt_validation["confidence"] >= 0.7):
    # Candidate accepted
else:
    # Find replacement candidate and retry
```

#### 📊 Comprehensive Statistics
- **Before/After Scores**: Shows evaluation improvement from initial to final
- **Correction Counts**: Tracks how many candidates were replaced per category
- **Validation Metrics**: MongoDB checks, GPT validations, successful corrections

### Sample Output
```
Phase 1: Initial candidate search and evaluation
✅ Found 50 candidates for tax_lawyer.yml
Initial evaluation score: 0.743

❌ Candidate 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 not suitable: Lacks required JD degree
🔄 Trying replacement candidate 507f1f77bcf86cd799439012
✅ Candidate 507f1f77bcf86cd799439012 validated successfully

Final Results:
- Total corrections: 23
- Categories corrected: 7
- Final evaluation score: 0.847
