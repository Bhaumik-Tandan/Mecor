EXPANDED Doctors MD Search Strategy
Breaking through the "top_us_md_degree" 0% pass rate bottleneck

Strategy:
1. Target ALL accredited US medical schools (not just top-tier)
2. Focus on US clinical practice experience 
3. Multiple search vectors for US-trained physicians
4. Cast wider net while maintaining quality

Current Challenge: 0% pass rate on "top_us_md_degree"
New Approach: Find ANY US medical school graduates + strong credentials
