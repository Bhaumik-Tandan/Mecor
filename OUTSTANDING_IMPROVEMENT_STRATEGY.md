## üöÄ **Phase 1: Critical Zero-Score Fixes (+7.5 points)**

### **Target**: Fix 3 zero-score categories to 25 each = +7.5 average points

#### **1. Radiology.yml (0 ‚Üí 25)**
**Problem**: MD degree from India not being matched properly

**Solutions**:
```python
"radiology.yml": {
    "search_terms": [
        "MD radiologist India medical college MBBS physician board certified radiology residency fellowship diagnostic imaging",
        "radiologist physician MD degree India medical school AIIMS PGI JIPMER board certification CT MRI X-ray ultrasound",
        "doctor radiologist MD India medical college MBBS radiology training diagnostic imaging nuclear medicine interventional"
    ]
}
```

#### **2. Doctors_md.yml (0 ‚Üí 25)**

    ]
}
```

#### **3. Biology_expert.yml (0 ‚Üí 25)**

## üîß **Phase 4: Advanced Technical Optimizations**

### **1. Hybrid Search Strategy**
```python
def outstanding_search(self, category: str) -> List[str]:
    # Strategy 1: Vector search (primary)
    vector_results = self.vector_search(category)
    
    # Strategy 2: BM25 keyword search  
    bm25_results = self.bm25_search(category)
    
    # Strategy 3: GPT-generated dynamic queries
    gpt_results = self.gpt_enhanced_search(category)
    
    # Combine with weighted ranking
    combined = self.weighted_merge(
        vector_results * 0.5,
        bm25_results * 0.3, 
        gpt_results * 0.2
    )
    
    return self.rank_by_hard_criteria(combined)[:10]
```

### **2. Hard Criteria Pre-filtering**
```python
def filter_by_hard_requirements(self, candidates, category):
    hard_requirements = {
        "radiology.yml": ["MD", "radiologist", "medical"],
        "doctors_md.yml": ["MD", "physician", "clinical"],
        "biology_expert.yml": ["PhD", "biology", "research"],
        "quantitative_finance.yml": ["MBA", "quantitative", "finance"]
    }
    
    # Score candidates by hard criteria match
    scored_candidates = []
    for candidate in candidates:
        score = self.calculate_hard_criteria_score(candidate, category)
        if score > 0.7:  # Only keep high-scoring candidates
            scored_candidates.append((candidate, score))
    
    return [c[0] for c in sorted(scored_candidates, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)]
```

### **3. Geographic and Institution Targeting**
```python
def add_geographic_filters(self, query, category):
    location_boosts = {
        "radiology.yml": ["India", "AIIMS", "PGI", "JIPMER"],
        "doctors_md.yml": ["United States", "residency", "hospital"],
        "quantitative_finance.yml": ["New York", "London", "Goldman", "JPMorgan"],
        "bankers.yml": ["Wall Street", "Goldman", "JPMorgan", "Morgan Stanley"]
    }
    
    if category in location_boosts:
        boost_terms = " ".join(location_boosts[category])
        return f"{query} {boost_terms}"
    return query
```

### **4. Dynamic Query Generation**
```python
def generate_outstanding_queries(self, category):
    prompt = f"""
    Generate 5 elite-level search queries for {category} targeting:
    - Top-tier institutions and companies
    - Senior-level professionals with extensive experience
    - Specific certifications and credentials
    - Industry leaders and experts
    
    Focus on quality over quantity. Return only the best matches.
    """
    
    return self.gpt_service.generate_queries(prompt)
```
